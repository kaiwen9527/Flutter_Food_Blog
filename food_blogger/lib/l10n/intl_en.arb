    "peanutTofuContent": "        Peanut tofu itself is almost a combination of the light flavors of peanuts and tofu. It would be tasteless if eaten alone, so there is soy sauce to add on the side. It tastes quite good after being drizzled with soy sauce, but I think the combination of the two is a bit awkward and not as fusion as I imagined.\nThe difference between tofu pudding and the usual tofu pudding is that it is made with millet, a food unique to Pingtung. This makes the tofu pudding taste richer, and the millet is a good match, so the flavors won’t be different. overall very delicious.",

    "stinkyTofuContent": "        This enzyme stinky tofu is truly the best in the world. When I first came to this restaurant, I had to wait for quite a while because they fried the food upon order. But after taking a bite, I thought, 'It was worth the wait ~'.\nAlthough the environment is not very beautiful and exquisite, it is at least clean and sanitary. It is comfortable to enjoy the stinky tofu they added. Overall, I think it is great.",
